# Sangam-2019---ML-Hackathon-by-IITMAA
Indian metro cities are famous for their notoriously varied traffic volume that is experienced by commuters every day. People plagued with traffic jams often raise concerns over poor traffic management systems. But with so much technology at our disposal, why should we continue to deal with traffic management in obsolete ways?  In this modern and advanced era, why the problems regarding traffic management should be dealt with in obsolete ways?  Your city's Traffic Police department has decided to use Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence techniques to solve their traffic problems. They have collected traffic volume patterns and climate conditions that have been observed for 4 years. They want to be able to forecast the traffic volume.

Task: Your task is to predict the traffic volume for given time duration and climate conditions.
